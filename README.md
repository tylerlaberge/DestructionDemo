The goal of this project was to accurately simulate destruction in computer graphics. While I may not have completely succeeded in this hyper realistic endeavor, I still feel that the destruction I was able to simulate looks very good and I am happy with what I accomplished. I gained experience in physics engines during this project, and I learned many of the challenges involved with simulating destruction.
